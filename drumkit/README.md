Follow the beats!

Game Mode
1. Free Mode: just whack the keyboard. Toggle to view the assigned keyboard letter to each drumkit.
2. Play; comprises of several elements.
2a) timer of 30 seconds
2b) sequence: how many sequences to be followed (beat will be played every 0.5s)
2c) drumkit: how many drumkit to be activated
2d) every successful match of all the sequence will result in score +1 (user has 2.5s to match before the next sequence is played)
3. After timer reach 0, user has the option to reset the game.

Possible improvements/bug to be squashed
1. Proper reset function
2. After user has clicked x times = sequence, immediately match and play the next group of sequence
3. Assigning keyboard press as mechanism to match the sequence (instead of just clicked)
4. Keeping track of high score
5. Everytime user click play, do not allow repeated sound to be played
6. After timer reach zero, there will still be one set of sequence that is played.
